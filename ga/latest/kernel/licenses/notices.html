Source or<br>
   Object form, made available under the License, as 
indicated by a<br>
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the

   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in 
Source or Object<br>
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications<br>
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. 
For the purposes<br>
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the 
interfaces of,<br>
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, 
including<br>
   the original version of the Work and any modifications 
or additions<br>
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is 
intentionally<br>
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the 
copyright owner<br>
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit 
on behalf of<br>
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this 
definition, "submitted"<br>
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
communication sent<br>
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but 
not limited to<br>
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code 
control systems,<br>
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on

Contribution."<br>
<br>
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or

Licensor and<br>
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of,<br>
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and 
distribute the<br>
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer 
the Work,<br>
   where such license applies only to those patent claims 
licensable<br>
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
   institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work<br>
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
   as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the<br>
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or 
without<br>
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
   meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices<br>
       stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of<br>
       the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its<br>
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained<br>
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at 
least one<br>
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed<br>
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source 
form or<br>
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or,<br>
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, 
if and<br>
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. 
The contents<br>
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, 
alongside<br>
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided<br>
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be 
construed<br>
       as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
   may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use,<br>
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
   the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise,<br>
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion 
in the Work<br>
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed<br>
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the<br>
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions<br>
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS 
FOR A<br>
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any<br>
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under 
this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory,<br>
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the<br>
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
goodwill,<br>
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any 
and all<br>
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer,<br>
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity,<br>
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this<br>
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may 
act only<br>
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not 
on behalf<br>
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>

the purposes <br>
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works

interfaces of, <br>
the Work and Derivative Works thereof. <br>
<br>
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor <br>
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, <br>
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, 
prepare <br>

<br>
3. Grant of Patent License. <br>
<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each

royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this 
section) patent <br>
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, 
import, and <br>
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies 
only to those <br>

necessarily <br>
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination 
of their <br>
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) 
was <br>
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any 
entity <br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) 
alleging that the <br>
Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct <br>
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to <br>
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of 
the date such <br>
litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with 
respect to <br>
contributions by an individual employed by an institution 
or <br>
organization is limited to patent claims where the 
individual that is <br>
the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent 
claims <br>
licensed, and where the organization or institution has the 
right to <br>
grant such license under applicable grant and research 
funding <br>
agreements. No other express or implied licenses are 
granted. <br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. <br>

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
Derivative Works <br>
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and 
in Source or <br>
Object form, provided that You meet the following 
conditions: <br>
<br>
1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a <br>
   copy of this License; and <br>
<br>
2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating <br>
   that You changed the files; and <br>
<br>
3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works that You <br>
   distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
attribution notices <br>
   from the Source form of the Work, excluding those 
notices that do not <br>
   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and <br>
<br>
4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its <br>
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must include <br>
   a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
within such NOTICE <br>
   file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of the <br>
   Derivative Works, in at least one of the following 
places: within a <br>
   NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative 
Works; within the <br>
   Source form or documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative <br>
   Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and <br>
   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents of the <br>
   NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do 
not modify the <br>
   License. You may add Your own attribution notices within 
Derivative <br>
   Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum 
to the NOTICE <br>
   text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices <br>
   cannot be construed as modifying the License. <br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for 
any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License. <br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. <br>
<br>
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally <br>
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor 
shall be <br>
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional <br>
terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing 
herein shall <br>
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license 
agreement you may <br>
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. <br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. <br>
<br>
This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
names, <br>
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, except as <br>
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
origin of <br>
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. <br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. <br>
<br>
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
Licensor <br>
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on <br>
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, either <br>
express or implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or <br>
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A <br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the <br>
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks <br>
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this 
License. <br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. <br>
<br>
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including <br>
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
applicable law <br>
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed 
to in writing, <br>
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, 
including any <br>
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential 
damages of any <br>
character arising as a result of this License or out of the 
use or <br>
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to 
damages for loss <br>
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and <br>
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor has <br>
been advised of the possibility of such damages. <br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. <br>
<br>
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, 
You may <br>
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of 
support, warranty, <br>
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with <br>
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only <br>
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on 
behalf of any <br>
other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
defend, and hold <br>
each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims <br>
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such <br>
warranty or additional liability. <br>

 #<br>
 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, 
whether in its<br>

parties, PROVIDED<br>
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will 
ALWAYS appear<br>

basis.  <br>

4. Time Zone Database<br>
<br>
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from 
Time Zone <br>
  Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the 
TZ database <br>
  is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the 
Time Zone <br>
  Database section 7.<br>
<br>
  7.  Database Ownership<br>
<br>
    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or 
an IETF<br>
    document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly 
updated work<br>
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain 
in the <br>
    public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 
[RFC3979] do not <br>
    apply to the TZ Database or contributions that 
individuals make to <br>
    it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against 
the TZ <br>
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA 
Considerations <br>
    defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of 
understanding with the <br>
    IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all 
competent <br>
    court orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN 
or the IETF <br>
    Trust on the database or the code.  Any person making a 
contribution<br>
    to the database or code waives all rights to future 
claims in that<br>
    contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>
