**Important Notice: WebSphere Liberty beta is no longer available. The `beta` tag is now deprecated.** 

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in this directory is used to build the `websphere-liberty:beta` image on [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty/). The resultant image contains IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Beta and an IBM Java Runtime Environment.

# Usage

Instructions for using the image can be found on [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/websphere-liberty/). It is possible to build the image yourself by cloning this repository, change to the `beta/` directory and then issuing the command to build container image. For example, with Docker execute `docker build .`.
